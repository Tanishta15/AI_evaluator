• Problem Statement: Clearly defines a problem related to digital well-being, introduces agentic AI for personalized recommendations, emphasizes ethical considerations through Granite's oversight.
• Problem Statement: Clearly defines a unique, realistic problem, emphasizes user-centric approach, and integrates agentic AI for tailored recommendations.
• Problem Statement: Clearly defines a relevant problem in healthcare and mentions the use of Agentic AI and ethical oversight.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
• Problem Statement: Specify how this solution addresses healthcare themes such as patient safety, medical data privacy, or clinical validation. Mention traditional AI implementation details and provide evidence of bias testing.
• Problem Statement: Could benefit from explicit mention of IBM Watson Data Preparation Toolkit or AWS services used.
• Problem Statement: Needs more specifics on the data preparation toolkit, how Agentic AI will be applied, and evidence of a working prototype or clear plan for its development. Missing required elements include a YouTube video link, explicit mention of IBM or AWS, and details on bias testing methodology.
• Problem Statement: Needs more detail on how IBM/AWS will be used, prototype evidence, and bias testing methodology.
• Proposed Solution: Missing required elements include a working prototype, YouTube video link, and explicit mention of IBM or AWS. Also, more technical details on how Agentic AI and Granite are utilized would strengthen the proposal.

FILE SIZE OPTIMIZATION:
• Optimal file size (1.6MB) - processing efficiency bonus applied",[],healthcare
