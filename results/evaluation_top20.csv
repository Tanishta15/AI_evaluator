• Problem Statement: Clearly defines a unique problem in digital wellness, emphasizes ethical considerations and use of agentic AI for personalized recommendations.
• Problem Statement: Clearly defines a unique, realistic problem, utilizes agentic AI, and aligns with ethical guidelines set by IBM's Granite series.
• Problem Statement: Identifies a critical problem in digital well-being and suggests the use of agentic AI and data preparation for personalized recommendations.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
• Problem Statement: Lacks explicit mention of IBM or AWS, doesn't provide evidence of a working prototype, and doesn't detail how it differs from simple LLMs.
• Problem Statement: Could benefit from explicit mention of IBM or AWS, providing a working prototype, and detailing bias testing methodology.
• Problem Statement: Needs more specifics on the data preparation toolkit, how agentic AI will be applied, and evidence of a working prototype or clear plan for its development. Missing required elements include a YouTube video link, explicit mention of IBM or AWS, and details on bias testing methodology.
• Problem Statement: Needs more detail on the working prototype, specific technologies used, and how it differs from existing solutions.
• Proposed Solution: Missing required elements include a working prototype, clear identification of must-have technologies, and a YouTube video link. Additionally, more technical details on how Agentic AI and Granite models are utilized would strengthen the proposal.

FILE SIZE OPTIMIZATION:
• Optimal file size (1.7MB) - processing efficiency bonus applied",[],healthcare,0,Certificate Invalid
