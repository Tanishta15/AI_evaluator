## Certificate Verification Integration Summary

The certificate verification functionality from `certificate_verifier.py` has been successfully integrated into the AI Evaluator pipeline. Here's what was added:

### 🔧 **New Features Added**

1. **Certificate Verification Step in Pipeline**
   - Added `run_certificate_verification()` method to ContentEvaluatorPipeline class
   - Automatically runs after evaluation completion
   - Processes all submissions to detect and verify certificates

2. **New Certificate Verification Tab**
   - Added "Certificates" tab in the frontend interface
   - Shows verification results with status indicators (✅/❌)
   - Displays similarity scores and extracted information
   - Shows errors for failed verifications

3. **Enhanced Results Loading**
   - Loads certificate verification results from CSV
   - Integrates with existing results system
   - Saves results to `./results/certificate_verification.csv`

### 📁 **Files Modified**

1. **frontend.py**
   - Added certificate verification imports
   - Added certificate verification pipeline step
   - Added certificate verification results display functions
   - Added new tab and event handlers
   - Updated all yield statements for new output

### 📊 **Output Files**

After running evaluation, the following files will be available in `./results/`:
- `evaluation.csv` - Main evaluation results
- `evaluation_top20.csv` - Top 20 submissions 
- `evaluation_per_model.csv` - Per-model scores
- **`certificate_verification.csv`** - Certificate verification results ✨

### 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **Upload PPT files** → Document processing extracts images and text
2. **Run evaluation** → AI models score submissions  
3. **Certificate verification** → OCR detects certificates and matches against `data.csv`
4. **View results** → Check "Certificates" tab for verification status

### 📋 **Requirements**

- `pytesseract` package (already installed ✅)
- `data.csv` file with participant database (already exists ✅)
- Tesseract OCR binary (already available ✅)

### 🚀 **Ready to Use**

The enhanced pipeline is now ready to:
- Process 50+ PPT files efficiently
- Generate simplified table-based results
- Verify certificates automatically
- Export all results as downloadable CSV files

Simply run `python frontend.py` and upload your PPT files to see the complete evaluation and certificate verification in action!
